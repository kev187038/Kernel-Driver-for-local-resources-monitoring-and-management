Project: System Resource Monitor and Controller (SRMC)
Description: Develop a Linux kernel module that tracks CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage in real-time and provides mechanisms to limit or prioritize processes based on resource consumption.

Features to Implement:
Resource Monitoring:

Capture CPU and memory usage of processes.
Monitor disk I/O rates and bandwidth usage.
Use /proc or /sys to expose this data to user space.
Process Control:

Add the ability to throttle or prioritize processes based on user-defined rules (e.g., limit CPU usage for process X to 50%).
Implement a simple mechanism for terminating misbehaving processes.
Custom User Interface:

Expose controls via sysfs or procfs.
For example, write to /proc/srmc to set thresholds or enable/disable monitoring.
Notifications:

Use kernel notifications (via printk or user-space callbacks like uevent) when a process exceeds resource thresholds.
Security and Optimization:

Use locking mechanisms (spinlocks, mutexes) to handle concurrency.
Ensure minimal performance overhead when monitoring.
Why It Stands Out:
Practical Use: Demonstrates a mix of kernel development, resource management, and interaction with user space.
Marketable Skills: Includes skills like kernel programming, system performance optimization, and low-level debugging.
Customization: You can later extend this project with features like logging to a file or integrating with existing tools like top.
Bonus Ideas:
Add a GUI in user space that interacts with your module.
Implement a priority queue for processes that gives higher-priority ones more CPU time dynamically.
Make it configurable via a simple CLI or REST API.
